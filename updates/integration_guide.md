# DAYFORCE PAY CALCULATOR INTEGRATION GUIDE

## OVERVIEW
This guide explains how to integrate the real-time pay calculator functionality into the existing Dayforce Tracker Android app. The pay calculator builds on the working timesheet extraction to add live earnings tracking.

## PROJECT STATUS BEFORE INTEGRATION
âœ… **EXISTING FOUNDATION (Already Working)**:
- MainActivity.kt extracts timesheet data from Dayforce
- WebView successfully navigates and pulls punch times
- Accurate timesheet parsing (27.1h matches Python script)
- Basic UI showing timesheet data

## WHAT WE'RE ADDING
ðŸš€ **NEW PAY CALCULATOR FEATURES**:
- Real-time earnings display with live counter
- Pay rate settings screen
- Overtime/Sunday premium calculations
- Live updates every second while working
- Detailed pay breakdown

## FILE PLACEMENT INSTRUCTIONS

### 1. NEW KOTLIN FILES (Add to app/src/main/java/com/dayforcetracker/)

#### A) PayCalculator.kt
- **Purpose**: Core pay calculation logic with overtime rules
- **Location**: `app/src/main/java/com/dayforcetracker/PayCalculator.kt`
- **What it does**:
  * Calculates regular, overtime (1.5x), and Sunday premium (2x) pay
  * Handles real-time earnings updates
  * Determines current hourly rate based on hours worked
  * Formats currency and time displays

#### B) SettingsActivity.kt  
- **Purpose**: Pay rate configuration screen
- **Location**: `app/src/main/java/com/dayforcetracker/SettingsActivity.kt`
- **What it does**:
  * Provides UI for setting base hourly pay rate
  * Saves settings to SharedPreferences
  * Validates pay rate input
  * Shows pay rate preview (regular/overtime/Sunday rates)

### 2. NEW LAYOUT FILE (Add to app/src/main/res/layout/)

#### activity_settings.xml

## INTEGRATION PROCESS

### STEP 1: Add New Files
1. Create `PayCalculator.kt` in the java/com/dayforcetracker/ directory
2. Create `SettingsActivity.kt` in the java/com/dayforcetracker/ directory  
3. Create `activity_settings.xml` in the res/layout/ directory

### STEP 2: Update Existing Files
1. **MainActivity.kt**: Add the new imports and methods shown in the updated version
   - The key integration point is the `onTimesheetDataExtracted()` method
   - This gets called after your existing timesheet extraction completes
   - It parses the timesheet data into WorkDay objects and calculates pay

2. **activity_main.xml**: Replace with the updated layout that includes pay display
   - Adds the pay calculator UI above your existing WebView
   - WebView remains unchanged for timesheet display

3. **app/build.gradle**: Add the new dependencies for CardView and Material Design

4. **AndroidManifest.xml**: Add the SettingsActivity declaration

### STEP 3: Key Integration Points

#### A) Timesheet Data Flow
```
Existing Flow:
WebView extracts data â†’ Display in WebView

New Flow:  
WebView extracts data â†’ Parse to WorkDay objects â†’ Calculate pay â†’ Display earnings + WebView
```

#### B) Real-Time Updates
```
When user is currently working:
Every 1 second â†’ Check elapsed time â†’ Calculate additional earnings â†’ Update display
```

#### C) Settings Integration
```
First launch â†’ Prompt for pay rate â†’ Save to SharedPreferences
Settings button â†’ Open SettingsActivity â†’ Update pay calculations
```

## WHAT EACH COMPONENT DOES

### PayCalculator.kt
- **calculatePay()**: Main method that takes WorkDay list and returns PayBreakdown
- **Overtime Logic**: Hours 1-40 = regular, 40+ = 1.5x rate
- **Sunday Premium**: 2x rate but ONLY if already worked 40+ hours that week
- **Real-time**: calculateLiveEarnings() adds current session earnings
- **Format helpers**: Currency and time formatting for display

### SettingsActivity.kt
- **Pay Rate Input**: Validates and saves hourly rate (with $ prefix/suffix)
- **SharedPreferences**: Persistent storage for settings
- **Rate Preview**: Shows regular ($20), overtime ($30), Sunday ($40) rates
- **Validation**: Ensures rate is reasonable (>$0, <$1000)

### Updated MainActivity.kt Integration
- **parseTimesheetToWorkDays()**: Converts your existing extraction into WorkDay objects
- **updatePayDisplay()**: Updates the earnings UI with calculated values
- **startRealTimeUpdates()**: Begins 1-second timer for live earnings
- **Settings integration**: Opens SettingsActivity and handles results

### Updated UI Layout
- **Pay Card**: Large earnings display at top ($1,340.50)
- **Live Counter**: Updates every second (+$0.43/min)
- **Action Buttons**: Settings, Refresh, Details
- **Existing WebView**: Unchanged timesheet display below
- **Status Bar**: Connection status at bottom

## DATA FLOW EXAMPLE

### Sample Week Calculation:
```
Monday: 8h @ $20/hr = $160 (regular)
Tuesday: 8h @ $20/hr = $160 (regular)  
Wednesday: 8h @ $20/hr = $160 (regular)
Thursday: 8h @ $20/hr = $160 (regular)
Friday: 8h @ $20/hr = $160 (regular) [40h total - threshold reached]
Saturday: 6h @ $30/hr = $180 (1.5x overtime)
Sunday: 8h @ $40/hr = $320 (2x Sunday premium - only because >40h by Sunday)

Total: $1,340
```

### Real-Time Updates:
```
If currently working on Saturday (overtime tier):
Base total: $1,160 (Mon-Fri complete)
Current rate: $30/hr (overtime)
Live counter: +$0.50/minute
Display updates every second with accumulating earnings
```

## TESTING CHECKLIST

### After Integration:
âœ… App launches and prompts for pay rate setup (first time)
âœ… Settings screen saves/loads pay rate correctly
âœ… Timesheet extraction still works (existing functionality preserved)
âœ… Pay calculations show correct regular/overtime/Sunday breakdown
âœ… Real-time counter updates when currently working
âœ… Live counter stops when not working
âœ… Settings button opens pay rate configuration
âœ… Details button shows breakdown popup
âœ… App survives rotation and background/foreground switches

### Edge Cases to Test:
âœ… No timesheet data (shows $0.00)
âœ… Working exactly 40 hours (tests overtime threshold)
âœ… Sunday work with <40 hours (should be regular rate)
âœ… Sunday work with >40 hours (should be 2x rate)
âœ… Currently working vs not working detection
âœ… Invalid pay rate input handling

## ARCHITECTURE NOTES

### Design Principles:
- **Non-destructive**: Existing timesheet extraction unchanged
- **Modular**: PayCalculator is self-contained and reusable
- **Persistent**: Settings survive app restarts
- **Performance**: Live updates only run when actually working
- **User-friendly**: Clear UI with helpful information

### Future-Ready:
- PayCalculator designed for Samsung Watch integration (Day 2)
- Data structures ready for multi-week history
- Settings expandable for more pay rules
- Real-time system ready for background operation

---

## TROUBLESHOOTING

### Common Issues:
1. **Settings not saving**: Check SharedPreferences key names match
2. **Live counter not starting**: Verify isCurrentlyAtWork() logic
3. **Wrong calculations**: Check day-of-week parsing and hour accumulation
4. **UI not updating**: Ensure runOnUiThread() wraps UI updates
5. **App crashes on settings**: Verify AndroidManifest.xml has SettingsActivity

### Debug Tips:
- Add Log.d() statements in PayCalculator.calculatePay()
- Test with known timesheet data (27.1h example)
- Verify SharedPreferences values in device settings
- Check that parseTimesheetToWorkDays() correctly maps your extraction format

## SUCCESS CRITERIA

âœ… **Integration Complete When**:
- Existing timesheet extraction still works perfectly
- Pay calculator shows accurate earnings matching manual calculations  
- Real-time counter updates smoothly when working
- Settings screen saves and loads pay rate
- All overtime/Sunday premium rules work correctly
- UI is clean and informative
- Ready for Samsung Watch integration (Day 2)

This integration transforms your working timesheet extractor into a comprehensive real-time pay tracking system while preserving all existing functionality.
